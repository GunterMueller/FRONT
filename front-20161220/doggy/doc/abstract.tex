Doggy is a generator for graph transformations.
The transformations are described by means of rewrite rules,
which are translated by Doggy into a C-module that uses
an API to access the graph under transformation.
Doggy is used as a tool for generating compiler transformations,
in particular syntax tree transformation, 
instruction selection and local optimizations.
