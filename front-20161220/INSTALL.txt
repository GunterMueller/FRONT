BASIC INSTALLATION

INSTALLATION NAMES

    By default the 'install' target will install the libraries in
    ${PWD}/`uname -s`/lib, and the header files in ${PWD}/`uname -s`/include.
    You can specify an installation prefix other than ${PWD}/`uname -s` by
    modifying the 'PREFIX' variable. An Example:

        make install PREFIX=$HOME


64 BIT

    Front does not compile for 64 bit.
